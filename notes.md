* When I started this project I felt like I had a basic understanding of html which was conferting since I,m just worried about this right now and not things like javascript yet which I'm completly clueless on 
* I'm wondering how much I should plan ahead with this part of the project because there are so many things that I want to do but don't know how yet and I'm dreading having to redo some of this stuff later on
* its interesting how you can do the seemingly same task in different ways like moving to different pages with href= or just src= not everything obvious
* It's really fun to see how well css intertwinnes with html My "info-box" css in particular is really complicated because with its max-width and border-radius and its frankly a relief when I can just add "info-box" class and that's all. I was really worried that it would be more complicated on the html side
* I found some button css code that I like. I decided to use two seperate buttons with the exact same credentials because I think that I will need techinqally different buttons when I start js code so I have the right answer button and the wrong answer button that do the same thing at the moment
* I actually figured out I can do some things with my right and wrong buttons here in css! I used :after to make it so the right turns dark green and wrong turns dark red
* I have worked on python and C++ before and they have been a great introduction to Javascript
* I'm starting to see that my code doesn't look very pretty. I am making setShowInfo 10 times and adding them indiviually to each question section. I'm sure there are more effecient ways of doing this and I hope to look that up later but right now I'm just trying to write this js in a way that makes sense to me
* My const storedClicks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("buttonClicks")) || { button51: 0, button52: 0 }; took me a long time to figure out but I'm pretty sure that this finally got my answers to be retrieve the number of answes from localStorage
* It took me a long time to realize that I had to upgrade my buttons from using href to onclick. Now things are finally working
* I was honestly devistated that I needed to switch from javascript to react because I didn't want to rewrite all of my code that uses localstorage. Luckily with const handleButtonClick I just get the buttons from localstolstage as storedClicks and I implement storedClicks into setCorrectCount and setIncorrectCount from react to determine my answers which isn't too complicated
* I was having a really hard time using Navlink in my logout button which used /sort which is my homepage but then I remembered that in my sort I had my Route path='/' and once I made them match it worked out. I really have to be better at making sure that all my folders are aline
* Since pretty much all of my startup is about counting variable I have useState from React literally everywhere because I want my code to be correctly valued again very teadious 
* After finishing the react of the frontend of my code I thought I had completed everything that I wanted from the startup but now I see that the actual implementation of my website is really all in my service index.js code which is good to know
* I felt a little lost with the backend service code so I just started with let users = []; const scores = []; because I knew that that was what I wanted to do and kind of worked from there I think that was a good way of thinking about it instead of just going streaight to simon code and taking what I can from it like I usually do.
* I was having trouble making the setup for the password and username. Then I sound examples of uui and hash for the username and password respectably. const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10); const user = { id: uuid.v4(), username, password: hashedPassword };
* I was worried that creating the percentile values was going to be really complicated but once I have all the values setup it I just divided them and multiplied by 100. Sometimes code is completly readable.
* consol.log is the connective tissue between the front and backend since it prints the values to the console. I need to make sure that it's bring correctly used otherwise everything I do in the backend is useless
* Mongodb is to backend as React was to front end. It's like all my code is getting an upgrade
* I replaced users = []; const scores = []; with a const url because they need to be connected to a mongodb database instead of just being two empty arrays. It is honestly pretty embarising how long this took me to figure out
* websocket is something that I wasn't even thinking about when I first made this code but thankfully I can just send my score to people which worked nicely
* My peerProxy.js code uses socketServer.on to determine when the client connects and the socket.isAlive = true is a flag to see if they are still connected
* I use if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) inside of if (message.type === "sharedScore") to determine when I share my scores
* I was struggling to change my index.js to use websocket untill I added let db; as an unnassigned database connection. Using this in my code prevented unnecessary database connections until they were actually needed and made my code run smoother
* In my front end I made the const shareScore function which creates the message I want to share, uses writeText(message) to copy the score message to the clipboard, and sends the score message to the WebSocket server as a JSON object
